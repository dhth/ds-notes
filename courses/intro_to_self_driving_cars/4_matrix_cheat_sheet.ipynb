    "* **Scalar** - A scalar is just a number like 1.2, -5, 0, or 239. When we use the word **scalar** it's usually to highlight that we are *not* talking about a **vector** or a **matrix**. \n",
    "* **Matrix** - A matrix is a rectangular grid of numbers. For example, this is a matrix with  **2 rows** and **3 columns** so we would call it a $2\\times 3$ \"2 by 3\" matrix.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}1.5 & -9.2 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "5.4 & 7 & 2.2\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Row / Column** - These terms describe the horizontal (row) and vertical (column) sequences of numbers in a matrix. For example, the first row in the matrix above is $\\begin{bmatrix}1.5 & -9.2 & 0\\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "* **Vector** - A vector is a matrix where either the width or the height is 1. When the height is 1, it's called a **row vector**. When the width is 1 it's called a **column vector**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Matrix Element** - The **element** in the first row and first column of the matrix given above is the number $1.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Square Matrix** - A matrix is square when its height is equal to its width.\n",
    "* **Main Diagonal** - The main diagonal of a **square matrix** is the sequence of **elements** from the top left to bottom right. For the matrix below the main diagonal refers to the numbers 2 and 6.\n",

    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}2 & 9 \\\\ -4 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "* **Identity Matrix** - This is a special **square matrix** where all of the **elements** are equal to zero except those on the **main diagonal**, which are equal to 1. This is a $3\\times 3$ identity matrix:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "Multiplication of Matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ with matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ is only possible if the width of $\\mathbf{A}$ is equal to the height of $\\mathbf{B}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\mathbf{A}$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix and $\\mathbf{B}$ is an $n \\times p$ matrix, their product $\\mathbf{AB}$ is an $m \\times p$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiplying two matrices, we can calculate the value of the element at row $i$ and column $j$ with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\mathbf{AB})_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transpose\n",
    "The transpose of a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is given by $\\mathbf{A^T}$ and can be thought of in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **rows** of $\\mathbf{A^T}$ are the **columns** of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "* The **columns** of $\\mathbf{A^T}$ are the **rows** of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the element at row $i$ and column $j$ of the transpose is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[\\mathbf{A^T}]_{ij} = [\\mathbf{A}]_{ji}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trace\n",
    "The trace of an $n\\times n$ square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is the sum of the elements on the **main diagonal** of the matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{tr}\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} = a_{11} + a_{22} + \\dots + a_{nn}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determinant\n",
    "The [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) is a useful value when describing a matrix. It can be denoted in one of three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\text{det } \\left(\\mathbf{A}\\right)$\n",
    "2. $\\text{det } \\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "3. $|\\mathbf{A}|$\n",
    "\n",
    "**1x1 Matrices**\n",
    "\n",
    "The determinant of a $1\\times1$ matrix is just the value of the matrice's only element. For example if $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{vmatrix}4\\end{vmatrix}$, then the determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{vmatrix}\\mathbf{A}\\end{vmatrix} = 4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2x2 Matrices**\n",
    "\n",
    "The determinant of a $2\\times2$ matrix is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{vmatrix}\\mathbf{A}\\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n",
    "a & b \\\\\n",
    "c & d \\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse\n",
    "The inverse of a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is given by $\\mathbf{A^{-1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is **invertible** if there exists a matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ such that the product of $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the **identity matrix** $\\mathbf{I}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{AB} = \\mathbf{BA} = \\mathbf{I}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**1x1 Matrices**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a $1\\times1$ matrix with a single element with value $a$, the inverse is simlpy $\\frac{1}{a}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2x2 Matrices**\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of a $2\\times 2$ matrix is given by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\text{det }\\mathbf{A}} \\left[\\left(\\text{tr } \\mathbf{A}\\right) \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A}\\right]$$\n",
