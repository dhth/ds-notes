# Gaussian Distribution

Variance relates to confusion and certainity. 

Wider gaussian curve -> higher variance -> higher confusion --> lower certainity

Narrower gaussian curve -> lower variance -> lower confusion --> higher certainity

# Kalman Filters

2 stages:
- measurement update (using Bayes' rule)
- motion update (using total probability distribution)

## Measurement update

Posterior peak is higher as measurement increases certainity.

## Motion update

Prediction peak is lower as there's uncertainity involved with motion.
